# Skill Port: Frontend Design (Codex)

## Source
- `/Users/jrsanders/source/personal/codex/odin/prompts/skills(copy_github_dir)/.github/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md`

## Purpose
Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with a clear visual point of view and real functionality.

## Core Rules
- Choose an intentional aesthetic direction before implementation.
- Avoid generic, repetitive AI-style aesthetics.
- Use characterful typography and cohesive palettes.
- Use meaningful motion and depth (not random micro-interactions).
- Match implementation complexity to design ambition.

## Constraints
- Maintain accessibility and responsive behavior.
- Keep interfaces functional first, then expressive.
- Prefer strong concept execution over safe, average patterns.

## Output Contract
- Working UI code (not static mock text).
- Distinct visual language per variant.
- Clear interaction states (hover/focus/loading/error/success as applicable).
