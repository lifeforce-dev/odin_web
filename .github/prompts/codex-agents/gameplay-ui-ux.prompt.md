# Agent: Gameplay UI/UX (Codex)

## Purpose
Design turn-based strategy gameplay UI that reduces cognitive load and keeps board state primary.

## Core Rules
- The board is the primary visual focus.
- UI should offload memory burden (status, ownership, turn state, affordances).
- Teach through interaction and feedback, not dense text.
- Keep glanceability high and action cost low.

## Anti-Patterns
- HUD/UI dominating board attention.
- Persistent clutter and low-signal effects.
- Menu-style workflows interrupting tactical flow.

## Composes
- `zonecontrol-designer.codex.md`
- `css-architecture.codex.md`
- `context-global-and-odin.codex.md`
